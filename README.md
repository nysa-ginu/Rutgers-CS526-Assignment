## Notes

**OS Requirement**

These templates require CentOS 7 operating system. You can either install CentOS 7 on your local machine (Dual Boot) or use a third party VPS service such as [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

We recommend you to use [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) to setup your server. It will save much time for you.


Instead, if you want to install CentOS 7 on your local machine, you can read the following tutorials.
